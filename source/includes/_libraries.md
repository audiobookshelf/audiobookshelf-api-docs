His world, his very beliefs, are shattered when ancient debts come due with thundering violence. In a dark age it takes courage to live, and more than mere courage to challenge those who hold dominion, Richard and Kahlan must take up that challenge or become the next victims. Beyond awaits a bewitching land where even the best of their hearts could betray them. Yet, Richard fears nothing so much as what secrets his sword might reveal about his own soul. Falling in love would destroy them - for reasons Richard can't imagine and Kahlan dare not say. In their darkest hour, hunted relentlessly, tormented by treachery and loss, Kahlan calls upon Richard to reach beyond his sword - to invoke within himself something more noble. Neither knows that the rules of battle have just changed...or that their time has run out. Wizard's First Rule is the beginning. One book. One Rule. Witness the birth of a legend.",

| `results`        | Array of [Library Item](#library-item) | The requested library items. If `minified` is `true`, it will be an array of [Library Item Minified](#library-item-minified). `collapseseries` will add a [Series Num Books](#series-num-books) as `collapsedSeries` to the library items, with only one library item per series. However, if there is only one series in the results, they will not be collapsed. When filtering by series, `media.metadata.series` will be replaced by the matching [Series Sequence](#series-sequence) object. If filtering by series, `collapseseries` is `true`, and there are multiple series, such as a subseries, a `seriesSequenceList` string attribute is added to `collapsedSeries` which represents the items in the subseries that are in the filtered series. `rssfeed` will add an [RSS Feed Minified](#rss-feed-minified) object or `null` as `rssFeed` to the library items, the item's RSS feed if it has one open. |

His world, his very beliefs, are shattered when ancient debts come due with thundering violence. In a dark age it takes courage to live, and more than mere courage to challenge those who hold dominion, Richard and Kahlan must take up that challenge or become the next victims. Beyond awaits a bewitching land where even the best of their hearts could betray them. Yet, Richard fears nothing so much as what secrets his sword might reveal about his own soul. Falling in love would destroy them - for reasons Richard can't imagine and Kahlan dare not say. In their darkest hour, hunted relentlessly, tormented by treachery and loss, Kahlan calls upon Richard to reach beyond his sword - to invoke within himself something more noble. Neither knows that the rules of battle have just changed...or that their time has run out. Wizard's First Rule is the beginning. One book. One Rule. Witness the birth of a legend.",

His world, his very beliefs, are shattered when ancient debts come due with thundering violence. In a dark age it takes courage to live, and more than mere courage to challenge those who hold dominion, Richard and Kahlan must take up that challenge or become the next victims. Beyond awaits a bewitching land where even the best of their hearts could betray them. Yet, Richard fears nothing so much as what secrets his sword might reveal about his own soul. Falling in love would destroy them - for reasons Richard can't imagine and Kahlan dare not say. In their darkest hour, hunted relentlessly, tormented by treachery and loss, Kahlan calls upon Richard to reach beyond his sword - to invoke within himself something more noble. Neither knows that the rules of battle have just changed...or that their time has run out. Wizard's First Rule is the beginning. One book. One Rule. Witness the birth of a legend.",

His world, his very beliefs, are shattered when ancient debts come due with thundering violence. In a dark age it takes courage to live, and more than mere courage to challenge those who hold dominion, Richard and Kahlan must take up that challenge or become the next victims. Beyond awaits a bewitching land where even the best of their hearts could betray them. Yet, Richard fears nothing so much as what secrets his sword might reveal about his own soul. Falling in love would destroy them - for reasons Richard can't imagine and Kahlan dare not say. In their darkest hour, hunted relentlessly, tormented by treachery and loss, Kahlan calls upon Richard to reach beyond his sword - to invoke within himself something more noble. Neither knows that the rules of battle have just changed...or that their time has run out. Wizard's First Rule is the beginning. One book. One Rule. Witness the birth of a legend.",
