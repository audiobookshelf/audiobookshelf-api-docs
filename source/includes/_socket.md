# Socket

Audiobookshelf uses [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) for bidirectional communication between clients and the server.
Each client must first authenticate itself using a user's API token in order to subscribe to events for that user.
There is also [an example](https://github.com/advplyr/abs-socket-client-demo) for how to use the socket.

<aside class="notice">
If the socket gets disconnected and then re-connects, it will have a new socket ID and will need to authenticate again.

## Client Events

> `auth`

```js
socket.emit('auth', 'exJhbGciOiJI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2Vyi5NDEyODc4fQ.ZraBFohS4Tg39NszY')
```

> `cancel_scan`

```js
socket.emit('cancel_scan', 'lib_c1u6t4p45c35rf0nzd')
```

> `set_log_listener`

```js
socket.emit('set_log_listener', 2)
```

> `message_all_users`

```js
socket.emit('message_all_users', { message: 'Message from admin' })
```

These are events that clients can emit. See [Miscellaneous Events](#miscellaneous-events) for events that the server responds to these events with.
