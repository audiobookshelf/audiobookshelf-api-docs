# Introduction

<aside class="warning">These API docs are out-of-date and are no longer maintained. We hope to implement automated OpenAPI docs in the future.</aside>

# Authentication

Audiobookshelf uses a users API token as a Bearer token for requests. For GET requests the API token can optionally be passed in as a query string.

You can find your API token by logging into the Audiobookshelf web app as an admin, go to the config â†’ users page, and click on your account.

You may also get the API token programmatically using the [Login](#login) endpoint. The API token will be in the response at `response.user.token`.

API request header for authentication would look like this:

`Authorization: Bearer exJhbGciOiJI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2Vyi5NDEyODc4fQ.ZraBFohS4Tg39NszY`

Optionally GET requests can use the API token like this:

`https://abs.example.com/api/items/li_asdfalwkerioa?token=exJhbGciOiJI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2Vyi5NDEyODc4fQ.ZraBFohS4Tg39NszY`

<aside class="notice">
Your API token will be much longer then the one in the examples.
